/*
rem and em units are not linked to the html font-size property in media queries. Their default value is 16px, even if we changed it in a CSS file.

1 rem = 1 em = 16px

rem - root font-size
em - current font-size

Let's cut to the chase.
We should NOT use rem units for media queries are there are some known bugs.
Instead we SHOULD use em units.
*/

/* 
Remember, we don't want to use px or rem units. We are going to use em values for setting breakpoints.

In order to calculate the em value, we have to divide the desired max-width by 16.

1350 / 16 = 84.375
